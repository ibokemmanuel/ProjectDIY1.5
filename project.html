<p><span style="font-size: 80px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">F</span>or past two decades,tec project 1.5 has work on the issues at the intersection of the education and technology sectors in middle-and low income countries and emerging market Around the world.<br> it's been a facinating job:
 over the past 12 years, the project 1.5 has been an advisor to, evaluator of,and /or working-level participant in, educational technology ("Edtech") initiatives in over 50 countries.<br>When it comes to ICT use in education, the promised revolution
 always seem to be just around the corner. indeed: we are regularly pitched ideas by people who note that,while many past promise promises about potential of the use new technologies in education has failed to pan out,they are confident that "this time,it's different".
 
 

 <br>At the same time,we are quite often asked to help other folks identify
 intriguing initiative that might ,individually and/or collectively,<br> illuminate emerging trend and approaches in this sector:

<br>We receive a version of this request most every week<br>(sometimes even multiple times in a single day.)Given
the frequency of such inquiries, i though i'd quickly highlight 20 such effort from around the world.<br>ln the hope that people
might find this useful,the hope is to build people that are in "TEC SPACE" to know the usefulness of Tec around the world...
